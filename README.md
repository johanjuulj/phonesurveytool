# phonesurveytool

Is an open source project enabling organizations collect data on projects utilizing SMS and WhatsApp survey’s. The tool was built to enable social impact organization who are using Kobo Collect or ODK as “hands-on” surveying tools to collect data more rapidly and efficiently. The project is still in an early stage of development, use with caution and ensure you back-upp all of your data. The section below explain the code and guides you to set up the phonesurveytool web application and gets you started with Twilio.

## Roadmap

The project was developed as a part of a project at DTU and has been customized for a couple of organizations needing it for implementations with various development projects. There is no current development ongoing on the phonesurveytool but in the future I might work on customization features such as
Account management
Messaging authority
Gateway customization (Twilio/Africa’sTalking and more)
For now several of these things are hardcoded.
